MineSweeper


Rules of MineSweeper:

There are two actions that you can do while playing minesweeper

1: digging the squares:
you do this by hovering over the square you want to dig and pressing the letter "d" on your keyboard

2. placing flags:
you do this by hovering over the square you want to place a flag and pressing the letter "f" on your keyboard


after digging, the numbers on each square represent the number mines that are next to that square
use this information to determine where is a mine, and where is safe

To win the game you must open every single square that does not contain a mine






In the game there is a timer that tells you how many seconds each game was

There is also best Time that shows you the fastest you have played the game

Warning:
if you exit the game with the exit button on the tab, your best time will not be remebered, please use the exit button created by the software
to keep track of your best time
